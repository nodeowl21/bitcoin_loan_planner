# 🟠 Bitcoin Loan Planner

**Simulate leveraged BTC strategies with dynamic rebalancing, risk control, and long-term planning.**  
This open-source tool helps you explore what happens when you use Bitcoin-backed loans to stack more sats.

🧠 Motivation

Bitcoin-backed loans are becoming increasingly attractive:
⚖️ lower rates, fairer terms.

As Bitcoin goes up forever, these loans allow you to cover everyday expenses — all while sticking to the principle of “never sell your Bitcoin.”

But you can also use them to leverage up and stack more sats — borrowing to buy more BTC and using that as additional collateral.
Naturally, that comes with risk.

I built this simulator to explore the dynamics of such strategies:
How far can you push it? When do you get liquidated? And how much BTC do you actually end up with?

## FastAPI + React App

The Streamlit app is still available, but the migrated web stack lives in `backend/`
and `frontend/`.

Start the API:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
```

Start the React frontend in a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173.

The API exposes:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /btc-price?currency=USD`
- `POST /simulate`
- `POST /optimize`
